                 <p class="body-words"> <span style="color: hotpink;">Hello!!</span> Thank you for taking time to know about me.<br>
                  My names is <span class="gold-words">Jackline Wanjiru Njoroge</span> and i
                      am a <span class="gold-words">woman in technology</span> .I was born in the early
                      2000's as a fourth born in a family of five.My parents Ephantus Njoroge Kibere and
                      Sarah Kiarie welcomed me with love and named me <span class="gold-words">Jackline Wanjiru 
                      Njoroge </span> and for sure at no point have i ever sat down to question or regret about my names.
                        <br><br>
                      Life had to continue and so i grew up in Nairobi's <span class="gold-words">Kasarani </span> area,
                      where i experienced childhood all the way till 2010 where i joined a boarding school in Murang'a 
                      and got to experience a change in environment. Fast foward i finished my primary school in 2013 and attained 
                      <span class="gold-words">372 mark</span> in my KCPE that saw me join <span class="gold-words">
                      Kahuhia Girls in 2013</span>.
                      <br><br>
                      Four years ended in 2017 and i left Kahuhia Girls with a <span class="gold-words">C+</span> then joined
                      <span class="gold-words">Regional Center for Mapping of Resources</span> which is located a long Thika
                      in Roysambu. Despite the pandemic i managed to go through and complete my two years pursuing a
                      <span class="gold-words"> KNEC Diploma in Information Communication Technology</span> and passed with a
                      <span class="gold-words">Credit</span>.
                      
                      I was now out in school and now did not know what to do or where to begin from. So i decided to take a
                      two months break to just relax and make use of my hobbies such as cooking sweet meals. During this time
                      word reached to me that  <span class="gold-words">Moringa School</span> was offering scholarships for 
                      100 women willing to become  <span class="gold-words">Women in Tech</span>. 
                      
                      I was skeptical because i was wondering, "will i be among the selected few?". BY God's grace or as the 
                      goes 'Mungu ni Nani'...... i was selected... like i was picked to be a woman in technology. This is how
                      on February 15th i begun my journey with  <span class="gold-words">Moringa School</span> to be nurtured to
                      become a  <span class="gold-words">Software Developer</span>.
                      <br><br>
                      I didn't mention but in the beginning of 2019 i started my career in <span class="gold-words">Social Media Marketing</span>
                      with <span class="gold-words">wowzi Technologies</span> and so, with all that workload ihave to plan every of my day so that i can get to
                      accomodate and balance all aspects of my life.
